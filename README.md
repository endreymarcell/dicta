This repo holds the code for a demo in my 'vim in VS Code' talk. See it in action: https://prezi.com/v/n_kasoli5wzc/vim-speech-recognition  

The `core` package contains a Node script responsible for speech recognition and vim command pattern matching.  
The `vscode` package has a Code extension to visually display the results.

Disclaimer: this was written in a hurry and only for the demo, so it only needed to work but didn't need to look pretty.
